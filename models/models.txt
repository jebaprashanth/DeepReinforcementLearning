The models/ folder is a directory where the PyTorch model checkpoints are stored 
during and after training. A model checkpoint is a snapshot of the model's state 
at a particular point during training. It includes the current values of 
all the model parameters, as well as other information such as the current epoch number, 
the optimizer state, etc.

In the context of this research paper, the models/ folder 
might contain saved checkpoints for the trained actor and critic models, 
as well as any other models or components used in the training process. 
These checkpoints can be loaded and used to resume training from a particular point, 
or to make predictions with the trained model.
