The models/ folder is a directory where the PyTorch model checkpoints are stored during and after training. A model checkpoint is a snapshot of the model's state at a particular point during training. It includes the current values of all the model parameters, as well as other information such as the current epoch number, the optimizer state, etc.

In the context of this research paper, the models/ folder might contain saved checkpoints for the trained actor and critic models, as well as any other models or components used in the training process. These checkpoints can be loaded and used to resume training from a particular point, or to make predictions with the trained model.

The specific structure and format of the models/ folder may vary depending on the requirements of the project and the preferences of the developer, but it typically contains one or more files that represent the saved state of the model(s), along with any other relevant files or metadata.
