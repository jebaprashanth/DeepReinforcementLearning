============================================================================================

In this project structure, the data folder contains the historical financial data, which can be in the form of CSV files or any other suitable format. The models folder is used to store the PyTorch model checkpoints, which are saved periodically during training.

The src folder contains the main source code for the project. The agent.py file contains the PortfolioManager class, the env.py file contains the Environment class, the models.py file contains the Actor and Critic classes, the replay_buffer.py file contains the ReplayBuffer class, and the utils.py file contains utility functions for data preprocessing and other tasks.

The main.py script is the entry point for the project and is used to train and test the agent. This script imports the necessary classes and functions from the src folder and uses them to create and train the agent.

Finally, the config.py file contains the hyperparameters, paths, and other configurations for the project. This file is used to store and manage all the settings for the project in one place.

Of course, this project structure is just one possible example, and you may need to adapt it to your specific needs and preferences.
